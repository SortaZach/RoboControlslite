** Internal Registers and Architecture **

    ** General-Purpose Registers (R0-R31):
        These 32 registers are used by the CPU for arithmetic, logic and data manipulation
    
    ** Status Registers(SREG):
        Holds flags such as Zero, Carry, Negative, and Interrupt Enable bits.
    
    ** Stack Pointer(SP):
        Points to the top of the internal SRAM.
    
    ** Program Counter(PC):
        Tracks the next instructions address.
    
    ** Special Function Registers (SFRs):
        These include control registers for peripherals like ADC, Timers, USART, SPI and TWI (I2C).

** Timers and Counters **

    ** Timer0 (8-bit):
        - Reslolution: 8-bit
        - PWM Outputs: OC0A (typically PD6), OC0B (typically PD5)
        - Usage: 
            often used for system timings (millis(), delay() in arduino)

    ** Timer1 (16-bit):
        - Reslolution: 16-bit
        - PWM Outputs: OC1A (typically PB1), OC1B (typically PB2)
        - Usage:
            Ideal for high Reslolution applications, like servo control and precise pulse-width modulation.

    ** Timer2 (8-bit):
        - Reslolution: 8-bit
        - PWM Outputs: OC2A (typically PB3), OC2B(typically PD3)
        - Unique feature:
            Can operate asynchronously with an external clock source (useful for real-time clock designs and low-power applications)


** Interupts **

    ** External Interrupts:
        INT0 and INT1:
            - Located on PD2 and PD3 respectively.
            - Configurable for low level, any edge, rising edge, or falling edge triggering.
            - Controlled by EICRA (External Interrupt Control Register A) and enabled by EIMSK(External Interrupt Mask Register)
        
    ** Pin Change Interrupts:
        - Avalible on almost all I/O pins (grouped by port)
        - Allows you to detect a change on any configured pin using PCICR (Pin Change Interrupt Control Register) and PCMSK (Pin Change Mask Register) registers
        
    ** Other Interrupts:
        - Timer Interrupts:
            Each timer has associated Interrupts (overflow, compare match) for time-critical tasks.
        
        - USART, ADC, SPI, TWI Interupts:
            For handling data transfer and conversion events.
        
        - Watchdog Timers:
            Provides a safety reset mechanism if the system hangs.


** Peripherals and Communication **

    ** ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter): 
        - Reslolution: 10-bit (0-1023)
        - Multiplexer: Can select from pu to 8 analog channels (PC0-PC5)
        - Registers:
            ADMUX: Selects reference voltage and channels
            ADCSRA:  Controls the ADC operations (enable, start conversion, prescaler)

    ** USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Recivier/Transmitter)
        - Purpose: Serial Communication (e.g. with a computer or other microcontroller)
        - Registers:
            UCSRnA, UCSRnB, UCSRnC: Control and status registers.
            UDRn: Data register for transmission and reception.

** Extra Features **

** Watchdog timer:
    built-in timer that can reset the microcontroller if it becomes unresponsive. Cofigured via the WDTCSR register

** Brow-out Detection:
    Monitors the supply voltage and resets the device if the voltage drogs too low, ensuring reliable operation.

** Power-Saving Modes:
    Various sleep modes allow you to reduce power consumption when the microcontroller is idle.

** EEPROM:
    Non-volatile memory for storing small amounts of data that must persist across resets.
